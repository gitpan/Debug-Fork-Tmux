   Rename to 'Debug-Fork-Tmux' 'Debug-Fork-Tmux' is a more appropriate name
   for the module. This includes but not limited to: - Namespace change
   from Spunge::DB to Debug::Fork::Tmux; - Repositories rename from
   Spunge-DB to Debug-Fork-Tmux. Ticket: 61
   (4d0f20cf-f671-41ac-b8aa-1f6b42e8c1b4) Skip tests when no 'tmux' binary
   found Tests should be skipped if any of this: - No 'tmux' binary is
   found for execution; - 'tmux' binary returns the version < 1.6; - test
   is trying to run not under Tmux. 'TMUX' environment varuiable seems to
   show if we're under Tmux.
 - Naming improvements and a config tweakery feature Ticket 52
   (612a1586-80e9-4c87-a471-41da4af27900) start private subs with '_' This
   includes every sub in: - Spunge::DB namespace - Spunge::DB::Config
   namespace besides get_config() Private subs are those intended to be
   called from inside of the package only. Start each them with an
   underscore. This includes subroutines' names: - in the POD - in the
   tests - in the code Ticket 54 (727e4754-fa31-4e2a-bb0a-187fbbfbf8d2)
   configuration with environment variables Make it possible for the user
   to change by mean of environment the values of the configuration
   parameters, mostly adding the 'SPUNGE_' as a prefix to name them. Make
   the package Spunge::DB::Config: - all the settings should be retrieved
   into the Spunge::DB with get_spunge_conf( 'variable_name' ) command -
   POD on the settings should stay in the Spunge::DB. Spunge::DB::Config
   should link to the 'CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT' section though -
   names of the settings should be lowercase - all of the settings should
   be kept in the package lexical %_CONF Ticket 56
   (7ba4dc92-fbb3-4140-b059-6e2cba45d010) Make a constant or environment
   variable for a command in the tmux new window Currently Tmux makes a new
   window with a system command sleep 1000000 Make the command to be the
   constant assigned at the compilation from the environment variable. -
   config key is 'tmux_cmd_neww_exec' - environment variable is
   SPUNGE_TMUX_CMD_NEWW_EXEC
 - POD and tests improvements Ticket 30

   (120bc9ce-ad91-469f-8060-96aef1d0420e) Tmux and Perl dependencies in
   POD. Add to the DEPENDENCIES section of the POD: - Tmux, the terminal
   multiplexer; - Perl, the programmin language. supplied with web links to
   each of them. Ticket 39 (eb90c260-f020-48f7-a230-5262a04d57f0) don't
   check xt/ for strict and warnings t/10-use.t should not check xt/ for: -
   use strict - use warnings It should only check xt/ for syntax. Ticket 41
   (08917361-a765-4390-91a8-c7dacca551b2) dependencies satisfied in POD by
   perl minimum requirement The POD's 'DEPENDENCIES' section contains the
   modules already found in the minimum Perl version: - Config - Cwd - DB -
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker - File::Find - File::Spec Such a dependencies should
   be listed in one line. Ticket 43 (ae7f0794-ef68-43d8-beeb-42940c997fd1)

 - POD fixes Ticket 11 (fb4da310-a328-4fa3-b8b7-0185e95919a7) Smaller POD
   fixes: - build POD SYNOPSIS section. Disable DZP:PodVersion in favor of
   PodWeaver; - ' $DB::fork_TTY to the same <Str> ' should be enclosed in
   C<>; - AUTHOR section should include http://vereshagin.org; - Function
   names in the POD headers should be supplied the braces(); - Build
   CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT section in the POD; - Some of the  =sub
   headers lack '>' in favor of E<gt>. Ticket 14
   (0ec84f72-560e-4850-a31f-34b90518b338) DEPENDENCIES section: - Make a
   DEPENDENCIES section in the POD in a PBP way. Ticket 17
   (127641d7-69f1-4c5c-b937-3866c7ecd76b) write croak messages to
   DIAGNOSTICS POD DIAGNOSTICS POD should be filled with croak_on_cmd()
   messages. Ticket 19 (85782e29-4094-4cb4-9cf4-c9be38b5fa8a) Point POD
   links from perl built-ins to the corresponding perlfunc sections. Make
   them work in the resulting HTML: - L<system>; - L<fork>. all of them are
   perl built-in subroutines.
 - WORKSFORME Working code is created: - the module Spunge::DB with subs,
   docs, etc. - tests include: - 10-use.t tries to use the module. No bad
   if it only require()s the module instead of use() as module does not
   @EXPORT anything; - 20-cmd.t tries the basic commands and the module's
   built-in exception catching; - 30-tmux.t tries to call functions
   executing the Tmux.
 - Added 'use' and 'strict' test
 - Added synopsis to POD.
 - Test build
 - initial commit
