 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - Added GitHub page link

 - Ticket: 76 (f80aff98-37f9-41a4-aae3-088c5475a3d2)

v1.000005 2012-11-20T15:51:59
 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - id: 82 (03eb37ec-a0d9-4563-8d84-a3ac0464d9e7)
   
   summary: disable versions' report in HTML:
   
     - No versions shouldn't be regenerated on every build;
   
     - tidy up HTML for Docs/, too.


v1.000004 2012-11-20T09:51:59
 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - Ticket: 87 (ecc4ad40-c3f0-41d6-9ced-80ca3d508023)
   
   Test::Version seems to be missing from prereqs.  Some of the tests
   require Test::Version:
   
     t/10-use.t 	    (Wstat: 256 Tests: 46 Failed: 1)
       Failed test:  40
       Non-zero exit status: 1
     t/30-tmux.t	    (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1 Failed: 0)
       Parse errors: Bad plan.	You planned 0 tests but ran 1.
     Files=7, Tests=114,  2 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.09 sys +  1.13
   cusr  1.36 csys =  2.61 CPU)
   
     It was observed that the test suite seem to fail without these
   modules:
   
       Test::Version
   
   Plan for t/30-tmux.t 'skip_all' should be fixed, too.

   '\_' in headers in markdown README
   
     https://github.com/petr999/Debug-Fork-Tmux
   
   Test should be created for no backslashes in the resulting README.mkdn,
   headers at the least.
   
   GitHub page contains backslashes:
   
     - SPUNGE\_TMUX\_FQDN
   
     - SPUNGE\_TMUX\_CMD\_NEWW
   
     - SPUNGE\_TMUX\_CMD\_NEWW\_EXEC
   
     - SPUNGE\_TMUX\_CMD\_TTY
   
     - DB::get\_fork\_TTY()
   
     - \_spawn\_tty()
   
     - \_tmux\_new\_window()
   
     - \_tmux\_window\_tty( $window\_id )
   
     - \_read\_from\_cmd( $cmd => @args )
   
     - \_croak\_on\_cmd( $cmd => @args, $happen )
   
   Remove them.

v1.000001 2012-11-16T19:12:09
 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - Ticket: 71 (723ec51b-a15b-41e9-883c-086f13781d8e)
   
   skip some author tests
   
   Some of the xt/ tests shouldn't be in the master branch. They are too
   devel-centric. Technically this means: remove xt/ from master branch.
   
   Tests known to be absent in DZPB:TestingMania:
   
     - 30-fixme.t
   
     - 30-nobreakpoints.t
   
     - 50-complexity.t
   
     - 70-code-coverage.t
   
   They should stay.


1.000007 2012-11-25T14:03:51
 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - Perl6::Slurp unmet dependency for an author test
   
   Perl6::Slurp is required for 'xt/author/10-mkdn-no-backslashes.t' test.
   Added dependensy to:
   
     - Makefile.PL
   
     - Build.PL


v1.000000 2012-11-13T17:11:03
 [Peter Vereshagin <peter@vereshagin.org>]
 - CPAN preparations
   
   Ticket: 59 (8af01bf2-7400-41fc-8d01-5d535f1b7d13)
   
     Rename to 'Debug-Fork-Tmux'
   
     'Debug-Fork-Tmux' is a more appropriate name for the module. This
   includes
     but not limited to:
   
       - Namespace change from Spunge::DB to Debug::Fork::Tmux;
   
       - Repositories rename from Spunge-DB to Debug-Fork-Tmux.
   
   Ticket: 61 (4d0f20cf-f671-41ac-b8aa-1f6b42e8c1b4)
   
     Skip tests when no 'tmux' binary found
   
     Tests should be skipped if any of this:
   
       - No 'tmux' binary is found for execution;
   
       - 'tmux' binary returns the version < 1.6;
   
       - test is trying to run not under Tmux.
   
     'TMUX' environment varuiable seems to show if we're under Tmux.

 - Naming improvements and a config tweakery feature
   
   Ticket 52 (612a1586-80e9-4c87-a471-41da4af27900) start private subs
   with '_'
   
     This includes every sub in:
   
       - Spunge::DB namespace
   
       - Spunge::DB::Config namespace besides get_config()
   
   Private subs are those intended to be called from inside of the
   package only. Start each them with an underscore. This includes
   subroutines' names:
   
     - in the POD
   
     - in the tests
   
     - in the code
   
   Ticket 54 (727e4754-fa31-4e2a-bb0a-187fbbfbf8d2)
   
   configuration with environment variables
   
   Make it possible for the user to change by mean of environment the
   values of the configuration parameters, mostly adding the 'SPUNGE_' as
   a prefix to name them.
   
   Make the package Spunge::DB::Config:
   
     - all the settings should be retrieved into the Spunge::DB with
       get_spunge_conf( 'variable_name' ) command
   
     - POD on the settings should stay in the Spunge::DB.
       Spunge::DB::Config should link to the 'CONFIGURATION AND
       ENVIRONMENT' section though
   
     - names of the settings should be lowercase
   
     - all of the settings should be kept in the package lexical
       %_CONF
   
   Ticket 56 (7ba4dc92-fbb3-4140-b059-6e2cba45d010)
   
   Make a constant or environment variable for a command in the tmux new
   window
   
   Currently Tmux makes a new window with a system command
   
     sleep 1000000
   
   Make the command to be the constant assigned at the compilation from
   the environment variable.
   
     - config key is 'tmux_cmd_neww_exec'
   
     - environment variable is SPUNGE_TMUX_CMD_NEWW_EXEC

 - POD and tests improvements
   
   Ticket 30 (82676ebc-d911-43d7-96d9-8c9cbc906508)
   
     set up web links:
   
       - GitHub page of the Spunge-DB project;
   
       - GitWeb page  of the Spunge-DB project at a Vereshagin.Org;
   
       - Bugzilla page of the Spunge-DB project at a Vereshagin.Org, and
	 in a BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section, too.
   
   Ticket 37 (120bc9ce-ad91-469f-8060-96aef1d0420e)
   
     Tmux and Perl dependencies in POD. Add to the DEPENDENCIES section
     of the POD:
   
       - Tmux, the terminal multiplexer;
   
       - Perl, the programmin language.
   
     supplied with web links to each of them.
   
   Ticket 39 (eb90c260-f020-48f7-a230-5262a04d57f0)
   
     don't check xt/ for strict and warnings
   
     t/10-use.t should not check xt/ for:
   
       - use strict
   
       - use warnings
   
     It should only check xt/ for syntax.
   
   Ticket 41 (08917361-a765-4390-91a8-c7dacca551b2)
   
     dependencies satisfied in POD by perl minimum requirement
   
     The POD's 'DEPENDENCIES' section contains the modules already found
     in the minimum Perl version:
   
       - Config
   
       - Cwd
   
       - DB
   
       - ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   
       - File::Find
   
       - File::Spec
   
     Such a dependencies should be listed in one line.
   
   Ticket 43 (ae7f0794-ef68-43d8-beeb-42940c997fd1)

 - POD fixes
   
   Ticket 11 (fb4da310-a328-4fa3-b8b7-0185e95919a7)
   Smaller POD fixes:
   
     - build POD SYNOPSIS section. Disable DZP:PodVersion in favor of
       PodWeaver;
   
     - ' $DB::fork_TTY to the same <Str> ' should be enclosed in C<>;
   
     - AUTHOR section should include http://vereshagin.org;
   
     - Function names in the POD headers should be supplied the braces();
   
     - Build CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT section in the POD;

   Ticket 14 (0ec84f72-560e-4850-a31f-34b90518b338)
   DEPENDENCIES section:
   
     - Make a DEPENDENCIES section in the POD in a PBP way.
   
   Ticket 17 (127641d7-69f1-4c5c-b937-3866c7ecd76b)
   write croak messages to DIAGNOSTICS POD
   
   DIAGNOSTICS POD should be filled with croak_on_cmd() messages.
   
   Ticket 19 (85782e29-4094-4cb4-9cf4-c9be38b5fa8a)
   Point POD links from perl built-ins to the corresponding perlfunc
   sections. Make them work in the resulting HTML:
   
     - L<system>;
   
     - L<fork>.
   
   all of them are perl built-in subroutines.

 - WORKSFORME
   
   Working code is created:
   
     - the module Spunge::DB with subs, docs, etc.
     - tests include:
   
       - 10-use.t tries to use the module. No bad if it only require()s the
	 module instead of use() as module does not @EXPORT anything;
       - 20-cmd.t tries the basic commands and the module's built-in
   exception
	 catching;
       - 30-tmux.t tries to call functions executing the Tmux.

 - Added 'use' and 'strict' test

 - Added synopsis to POD.

 - Test build

 - initial commit
